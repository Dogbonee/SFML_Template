<h1>SFML Project Template</h1>
<p>This template is a good start to a SFML program that I made to reduce my time writing boilerplate code before starting an SFML project.</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>Simply insert the source files and CMakeLists.txt (if you are using CMake to build your project)</p>
<p>All files can be treated as project files and customized as such.</p>
<p>For those who are new to CMake or SFML, you can use either a package manager or set SFML_DIR to wherever you installed SFML ("SFML-Version/lib/cmake/SFML") </p>
